Front End Programming Nanodegree - build a portfolio site

It's been a while since I submitted a project, so I'm anxious to get feedback. All the files should be in this repository. I included a few extra image files because I was changing them up to see if they worked best. 

I didn't add any media queries, using bootstrap provided all the responsiveness I needed (I think). Not sure if I missed something, but it displayed in a way I was happy with on all the devices.
